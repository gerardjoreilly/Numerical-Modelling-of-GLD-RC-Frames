# Numerical Modelling of GLD RC Frames

This repository contains the OpenSees model described in Section 4.2 of O'Reilly and Sullivan [2017]. This model outlines the response of the three storey frame tested by Calvi et al. [2002] which was a frame designed for gravity loading only.

The different tools outlined throughout O'Reilly and Sullivan [2017] to model the behaviour of the beam-column elements in addition to the beam-column joints are included here and their use illustrated. This way users can adopt the proposed numerical modelling approach proposed by the authors using single procedure commands within OpenSees.
